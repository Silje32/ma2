are a popular part of spring and summer diets throughout America. Mouths water
from coast to coast each spring, when small white blossoms start to appear on
strawberry bushes. They announce the impending arrival of the ruby red berries
that so many people crave. Ripe strawberries taste sweet and have only a slight
hint of tartness. They are also one of the healthiest fruits around. There are
countless recipes for the luscious red berry, but many people prefer to eat them
fresh and unaccompanied. */
