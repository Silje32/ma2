//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?

ANSWER : A function literal is another new way of defining an unnamed function.
         The syntax for a function literal is much like a function statement,
				 except that it is used as an expression rather than a statement and no
				 function name is required.



2. What is the constructor?

ANSWER :
The constructor creates an object that is based on the original function. A new
object is being constructed using the "new" keyword.



3. What does the return statement do?

ANSWER : A return statement will stop the function. Any code after a return
         statement will not be executed.



4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();

ANSWER : 'inside my function'



5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.

ANSWER :
In JavaScript there are a few different types of scope :
01. Local scope
02. Global scope
03. Block scope

Local scope : When a variable object or function is only available
              locally to a function.

Global scope : When variables, object or functions are available to all.

Block scope : Declare with let and const which are available within the innermost
              block they are surrounded by.
